#+TITLE: sequoia-sq NEWS â€“ history of user-visible changes
#+STARTUP: content hidestars

* Changes in 0.29
** New functionality
   - `sq` now supports and implicitly uses a certificate store.  By
     default, `sq` uses the standard OpenPGP certificate directory.
     This is located at `$HOME/.local/share/pgp.cert.d` on XDG
     compliant systems.
   - `sq --no-cert-store`: A new switch to disable the use of the
     certificate store.
   - `sq --cert-store`: A new option to use an alternate certificate
     store.  Currently, only OpenPGP certificate directories are
     supported.
   - `sq import`: A new command to import certificates into the
     certificate store.
   - `sq export`: A new command to export certificates from the
     certificate store.
   - `sq encrypt --recipient-cert`: A new option to specify a
     recipient's certificate by fingerprint or key ID, which is then
     looked up in the certificate store.
   - `sq verify --signer-cert`: A new option to specify a signer's
     certificate by fingerprint or key ID, which is then looked up in
     the certificate store.
   - `sq verify` now also implicitly looks for missing certificates in
     the certificate store.  But, unless they are explicitly named
     using `--signer-cert`, they are not considered authenticated and
     the verification will always fail.
   - `sq certify`: If the certificate to certify is a fingerprint or
     Key ID, then the corresponding certificate is looked up in the
     certificate store.
