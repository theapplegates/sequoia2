We use the term \"certificate\", or \"cert\" for short, to refer to \
OpenPGP keys that do not contain secrets.  This subcommand provides \
primitives to generate and otherwise manipulate certs.

Conversely, we use the term \"key\" to refer to OpenPGP keys that do \
contain secrets.  See `sq key` for operations on keys.
