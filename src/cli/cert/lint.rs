`sq cert lint` checks the supplied certificates for the following \
SHA-1-related issues:

  - Whether a certificate revocation uses SHA-1.

  - Whether the current self signature for a non-revoked User ID uses \
    SHA-1.

  - Whether the current subkey binding signature for a non-revoked, \
    live subkey uses SHA-1.

  - Whether a primary key binding signature (\"backsig\") for a \
    non-revoked, live subkey uses SHA-1.

Diagnostics are printed to stderr.  At the end, some statistics are \
shown.  This is useful when examining a keyring.  If `--fix` is \
specified and at least one issue could be fixed, the fixed \
certificates are printed to stdout.

This tool does not currently support smart cards.  But, if only the \
subkeys are on a smart card, this tool may still be able to partially \
repair the certificate.  In particular, it will be able to fix any \
issues with User ID self signatures and subkey binding signatures for \
encryption-capable subkeys, but it will not be able to generate new \
primary key binding signatures for any signing-capable subkeys.
