"Generate a new key

Generating a key is the prerequisite to receiving encrypted messages \
and creating signatures.  There are a few parameters to this process, \
but we provide reasonable defaults for most users.

When generating a key, we also generate an emergency revocation \
certificate. This can be used in case the key is lost or compromised.  \
It is saved alongside the key.  This can be changed using the \
`--rev-cert` argument.

By default a key expires after {} years.  This can be changed using \
the `--expiration` argument.

`sq key generate` respects the reference time set by the top-level \
`--time` argument.  It sets the creation time of the primary key, any \
subkeys, and the binding signatures to the reference time.
