Revoke a certificate.

Creates a revocation certificate for a certificate.

If `--revoker` or `--revoker-file` is provided, then that key is used \
to create the revocation certificate.  If that key is different from \
the certificate that is being revoked, this results in a third-party \
revocation.  This is normally only useful if the owner of the \
certificate designated the key to be a designated revoker.

`sq key revoke` respects the reference time set by the top-level \
`--time` argument.  When set, it uses the specified time instead of \
the current time when determining what keys are valid, and it sets \
the revocation certificate's creation time to the reference time \
instead of the current time.
