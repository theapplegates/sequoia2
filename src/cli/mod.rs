// XXX: The following comment should be an inner comment, but cannot
// until https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66920 is resolved.

/// Defines the command-line interface.
///
/// This module contains sq's command-line interface, i.e. the clap
/// definitions and associated types that can be used by clap.
///
/// We also generate manual pages from this module.  To that end,
/// `build.rs` includes this module, so all of its dependencies must
/// be also listed as build-dependencies.  Further, this module must
/// be self-contained, i.e. it must not use code from other parts of
/// sq.
///
/// # Interface guidelines
///
/// In order to provide a consistent user experience, please follow
/// these guidelines.
///
/// ## General guidelines
///
/// - The same subcommand or option in different places should do the
///   same or an equivalent thing, and should use the same phrases in
///   the help texts, to the extent possible.
///
/// - Subcommands SHOULD be of the form `sq [OBJECT..] VERB`.
///
///   - The object SHOULD be present, except for the top level
///     commands `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `sign`, `verify`, and
///     `inspect`.
///
/// - Subcommands SHOULD be grouped by topic, and ordered from most
///   often used to least often used.
///
/// - Use the imperative mood in the first sentence documenting
///   commands, subcommands, and arguments.
///
/// ## Terminology
///
/// - "certificate" or "cert" instead of "public key", "key", or
///   "TPK".
///
/// - "key" instead of "secret key", "private key", or "TSK".
///
/// - "key server" instead of "keyserver".
///
/// - "Web of Trust" instead of other variations.
///
/// ## Typography
///
/// - The first line of the about texts MUST NOT end in a period.
///
/// - To define terms, enclose them in double quotes: `"certificate"`.
///
/// - To include inline code fragments, like options or other
///   subcommands, use back ticks: `--foo` or `sq foo bar`.
///
/// - When referring to options, do not include the `VALUENAME`.
///
/// - Enclose URLs in angle brackets: `<https://example.org>`.
///
/// - Use a spaced en dash for parenthetical statements (` â€“ `).
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// - Every subcommand SHOULD have at least one example.
///
/// - Every example MUST have a brief description.
///
/// - Examples SHOULD be short and to the point, they SHOULD NOT
///   include unnecessary options (like `--keyring`).
///
/// - Examples MUST use single quotes where necessary.
///
/// - Examples MUST NOT use unnecessary quoting.
// Workaround so that the above documentation is rendered somewhere in
// the API docs.
