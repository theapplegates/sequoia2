option.

When a certificate is retrieved from a WKD, and imported into the \
local certificate store, any User IDs with the email address that was \
looked up are certificated with a local WKD-specific key.  That proxy \
certificate is in turn certified as a minimally trusted CA (trust \
amount: 1 of 120) by the local trust root.  How much the WKD proxy CA \
is trusted can be tuned using `sq pki link add` or `sq pki link retract` \
in the usual way.

"Publish certificates in a Web Key Directory

Publishes certificates or certificate updates in a Web Key Directory \
(WKD).  You can create or update a WKD hierarchy on the local system by \
specifying a path as destination.

Typically, a WKD is stored on a web server.  If `--rsync` is given, this \
command manages remote WKD directory hierarchies by using rsync(1).

To insert a new certificate into the WKD, use `--cert`.

Any updates for certificates already existing in the WKD are \
automatically published.

Note: To update a WKD hierarchy, it is first copied to a temporary \
location on the local machine, new certificates or certificate updates \
are inserted into the local copy, and the hierarchy is copied back to \
its original location.  As this is not an atomic operation, care must \
be taken to avoid concurrent updates.
