"Authenticate certs using the Web of Trust

The \"Web of Trust\" is a decentralized trust model popularized by PGP. \
It is a superset of X.509, which is a hierarchical trust model, and is \
the most popular trust model on the public internet today.  As used on \
the public internet, however, X.509 relies on a handful of global \
certification authorities (CAs) who often undermine its security.

The Web of Trust is more nuanced than X.509.  Using the Web of Trust, \
require multiple, independent paths to authenticate a binding by only \
partially trusting CAs.  This prevents a single bad actor from \
compromising their security.  And those who have stronger security \
requirements can use the Web of Trust in a completely decentralized \
manner where only the individuals they select – who are not \
necessarily institutions – act as trusted introducers.
