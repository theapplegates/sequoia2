"Manage authenticated certificate and User ID links

Linking a certificate and User ID is one way of making `sq` consider a \
binding to be authentic.  Another way is to use `sq pki vouch certify` to \
certify the binding with an explicitly configured trust root.  The \
linking functionality is often easier to work with, and the \
information is private by default.

Authenticated bindings can be used to designate a certificate using a \
symbolic name.  For instance, using `sq encrypt`'s \
`--for-userid` and `--for-email` options, a user can \
designate a certificate using a User ID or an email address that is \
authenticated for that certificate.

`sq` also uses authenticated certificates to authenticate other \
data.  For instance, `sq verify` considers signatures made by an \
authenticated certificate to be authentic.

Users can create a link using `sq pki link add`.  That link can later be \
retracted using `sq pki link retract`.  A certificate can also be \
accepted as a trusted introducer by using `sq pki link authorize`.

`sq` implements linking using non-exportable certifications, and an \
implicit trust root.  An OpenPGP certificate directory, the default \
certificate store used by `sq`, includes a local trust root, which \
is stored under the `trust-root` special name.  When the user \
instructs `sq` to accept a binding, `sq` uses the local trust root \
to create a non-exportable certification, which it stores in the \
certificate directory.  In this way, operations that use the Web of \
Trust to authenticate a binding automatically use links.

When a user retracts a link, `sq` creates a new, non-exportable \
certification with zero trust.  This certification suppresses the \
previous link.

This causes `sq` to consider the certificate and user ID binding to be \
authentic.  You would do this if you are confident that a particular \
certificate should be associated with Alice, for example.  Note: this \
does not consider the certificate to be a trusted introducer; it only \
considers the binding to be authentic.  To authorize a certificate to \
be a trusted introducer use `sq pki link authorize`.

A link can be retracted using `sq pki link retract`.

This command is similar to `sq pki vouch certify`, but the certifications it \
makes are done using the certificate directory's trust root, not an \
arbitrary key.  Further, the certificates are marked as \
non-exportable.  The former makes it easier to manage certifications, \
especially when the user's certification key is offline.  And the \
latter improves the user's privacy, by reducing the chance that parts \
of the user's social graph is leaked when a certificate is shared.

By default a link never expires.  This can be overridden using \
`--expiration` argument.

`sq pki link add` respects the reference time set by the top-level \
`--time` argument. It sets the link's creation time to the reference \

Make a certificate a trusted introducer.

This causes `sq` to consider the certificate to be a be a trusted \
introducer.  Trusted introducer is another word for certification \
authority (CA).  When you link a trusted introducer, you consider \
certifications made by the trusted introducer to be valid.  A trusted \
introducer can also designate further trusted introducers.

As is, a trusted introducer has a lot of power.  This power can be \
limited in several ways.

  - The ability to specify further introducers can be constrained \
using the `--depth` parameter.

  - The degree to which an introducer is trusted can be changed using \
the `--amount` parameter.

  - The user IDs that an introducer can certify can be constrained by \
domain using the `--domain` parameter or a regular expression using \
the `--regex` parameter.

These mechanisms allow you to say that you are willing to rely on the \
CA for example.org, but only for user IDs that have an email address \
for example.org, for instance.

A link can be retracted using `sq pki link retract`.

This command is similar to `sq pki vouch authorize`, but the certifications \
it makes are done using the certificate directory's trust root, not an \

improves your privacy, by reducing the chance that parts of your \
social graph are leaked when a certificate is shared.

By default a link never expires.  Using the `--expiration` argument \
specific validity periods may be defined.  It allows for providing a \
point in time for validity to end or a validity duration.

`sq pki link authorize` respects the reference time set by the \
top-level `--time` argument. It sets the link's creation time to the \
reference time.
