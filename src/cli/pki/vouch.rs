A vouch is a potentially public statement that something is true.  In \
OpenPGP there are two main types of statements that you can make: \
certifications, and authorizations.

You can assert that a certificate belongs to a particular entity. \
This says nothing about an entity's trustworthiness.  For instance, \
you might certify `bob@nsa.gov` for a given certificate.  This just \
means that you think the person behind the email address `bob@nsa.gov` \
really controls that certificate.  That's a useful statement to make \
even if you don't trust that person to act in your interest.

Alternatively you can say that you believe a certificate is a \
reasonable trusted introducer.  A trusted introducer is a third-party \
that you authorize to make introductions.  For instance, your bank \
might have a certification authority (CA).  If you verify the CA's \
fingerprint, you can authorize it to make certifications.  That means \
that sq will use those certifications almost as if you made them. \
This is convenient as now you can authenticate any of the bank's \
employee.

Authorizing a trusted introducer gives the trusted introducer a lot of \
power.  You can constrain the amount of power that you give it by \
saying that it is only authorized to certify user IDs that have an \
email address in one or more domains, for instance.  In this way, you \
can take advantage of the places where your and a CA's interests are \
aligned, and protect yourself from potentially malicious actions.  For \
example, you could authorize your bank's CA to certify user IDs that \
have an email address in `bank.com`.  sq will then ignore any other \
certifications made by the CA.
