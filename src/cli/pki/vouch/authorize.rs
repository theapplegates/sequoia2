"Mark a certificate as a trusted introducer.

Creates a certification that says that the issuer considers the \
certificate to be a trusted introducer.  Trusted introducer is another \
word for certification authority (CA).  When a user relies on a \
trusted introducer, the user considers certifications made by the \
trusted introducer to be valid.  A trusted introducer can also \
designate further trusted introducers.

As is, a trusted introducer has a lot of power.  This power can be \
limited in several ways.

  - The ability to specify further introducers can be constrained \
using the `--depth` parameter.

  - The degree to which an introducer is trusted can be changed using \
the `--amount` parameter.

  - The user IDs that an introducer can certify can be constrained by \
domain using the `--domain` parameter or a regular expression using \
the `--regex` parameter.

These mechanisms allow Alice to say that she is willing to rely on the \
CA for example.org, but only for user IDs that have an email address \
for example.org, for instance.

By default a delegation expires after {} years. Use the `--expiration` \
argument to override this.

This subcommand respects the reference time set by the top-level \
`--time` argument.  It sets the certification's creation time to the \
reference time.
