Generating a key is the prerequisite to receiving encrypted messages

When generating a key, we also generate a revocation certificate.
This can be used in case the key is superseded, lost, or compromised.
It is a good idea to keep a copy of this in a safe place.

After generating a key, use \"sq key extract-cert\" to get the
certificate corresponding to the key.  The key must be kept secure,
while the certificate should be handed out to correspondents, e.g. by
uploading it to a keyserver.

Note that this operation does not reliably remove User IDs from a
certificate that has already been disseminated! (OpenPGP software
typically appends new information it receives about a certificate
to its local copy of that certificate.  Systems that have obtained
a copy of your certificate with the User ID that you are trying to
strip will not drop that User ID from their copy.)

In most cases, you will want to use the 'sq revoke userid' operation
instead.  That issues a revocation for a User ID, which can be used to mark
the User ID as invalidated.

However, this operation can be useful in very specific cases, in particular:
to remove a mistakenly added User ID before it has been uploaded to key
servers or otherwise shared.

Stripping a User ID may change how a certificate is interpreted.  This
is because information about the certificate like algorithm preferences,
the primary key's key flags, etc. is stored in the User ID's binding
signature.
