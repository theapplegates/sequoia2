An OpenPGP data stream consists of packets.  These tools allow working
with packet streams.  They are mostly of interest to developers, but
\"sq packet dump\" may be helpful to a wider audience both to provide
valuable information in bug reports to OpenPGP-related software, and
as a learning tool.

bytes are parsed into OpenPGP values.
