A revocation certificate indicates that a certificate, a subkey, a
User ID, or a signature should not be used anymore.

A revocation certificate includes two fields, a type and a
human-readable explanation, which allows the issuer to indicate why
the revocation certificate was issued.  It is important to set the
type field accurately as this allows an OpenPGP implementation to
better reason about artifacts whose validity relies on the revoked
object.  For instance, if a certificate is retired, it is reasonable
to consider signatures that it made prior to its retirement as still
being valid.  However, if a certificate's secret key material is
compromised, any signatures that it made should be considered
potentially forged, as they could have been made by an attacker and
backdated.

As the intent of a revocation certificate is to stop others from using
a certificate, it is necessary to distribute the revocation
certificate.  One effective way to do this is to upload the revocation
certificate to a keyserver.
