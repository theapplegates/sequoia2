If the WKD exists, the new keys will be inserted and it \

A WKD is per domain, and can be queried using the advanced or the \
direct method. The advanced method uses a URL with a subdomain \
'openpgpkey'. As per the specification, the advanced method is to be \
preferred. The direct method may only be used if the subdomain \
doesn't exist. The advanced method allows web key directories for \
several domains on one web server.

they are accessible under https://openpgpkey.example.com/.well-known/openpgp/... \
